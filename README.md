# DataStructureProject

We made a project on the topic named STUDENT MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM. This project is all about the record of the student in any
university. We implemented the code in the language C++ because all
our group members were familiar with it. Student management system is
an environment where all the processes of the student in the institution
are managed. This system saves the time of the student and of the
administrator. It includes processes like registration of the studentâ€™s
details, assigning the department based on their course and maintenance
of the record . This system reduces the cost and workforce required for
this job. As the system is online the information is globally present to
everyone. This makes the system easy to handle and feasible for finding
the omission with updating at the same time. This project will handle
multiple tasks through various functions used in the code. The various
functions used in the code are student login(), admin login(),get data(),
add data(), show data(), display data(), search data(), delete data(), get
trash(), modify data(), courses,student view(), admin view(), and
result().
